# Security policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do **not** report a security problem in a public issue, pull request or
forum post.

Report it privately through GitHub instead: open the **Security** tab of this
repository, then **Report a vulnerability**.

No such button? Private reporting is not enabled yet: open an issue that only
asks the maintainers for a private contact, without any detail of the problem,
and send the report there.

Include, when you can:

- the version of the integration and of Gladys;
- what an attacker can do, and the steps to reproduce it;
- the log lines that help (remove tokens, passwords and addresses first).

The fix ships as a new version of the integration, and the advisory is
published once users can update.

## Supported versions

Only the latest release receives security fixes: update the integration from
Gladys before reporting a problem.

## Scope

In scope: the code of this repository and the Docker image it publishes.

The integration reads the REST API of the Netdata agents configured in Gladys,
on the local network, and never writes to them. The optional bearer tokens
are kept by Gladys in the integration configuration, sent only to their agent
in an `Authorization` header, and never logged. Under `/data`, the integration
keeps one file: the alarms raised on each node at the last read, so that a
restart neither misses nor repeats an alarm transition. No credential is
stored there.

Out of scope: Gladys Assistant itself (see its
[security policy](https://github.com/GladysAssistant/Gladys/security/policy)),
Netdata and Netdata Cloud, and the machines they monitor.
